### `React Developer Coding Exercise`

This is a solution that I created for a coding exercise I received. I was asked to build a form with the following:<br>

• A valid Swedish social security number
• A vaild Swedish phone number
• Email address
• Country
• Submit button<br>

Restrictions:
• The social security number needs to be a valid Swedish SSN 
• The phone number needs to be a valid Swedish phone number
• The email address needs to be valid
• The countries needs to be displayed as a drop down box
• All fields are mandatory
• Validation errors needs to be displayed in some way if the input data is wrong.
• The Submit button needs to log "Success" to the console when clicked if, and only if, all fields are valid.
• The input fields need to persist their values upon refresh, e.g. by using local storage, so that their data
is still there is the user refreshes the page.
• Local storage needs to be emptied upon a successful Submit so that if the page is refreshed will display
empty fields.

### `npm install`

To install node modules.<br>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
